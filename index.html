            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p> Welcome to my very first webpage towards the completion of my nanodegree with Udacity. I thought
        i would take a few lines to say a bit about myself. So i'm Axelle and i'm originating from

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon">cameroon</a>
            . I currently live in Canada and my native language is french. I have a bachelor degree in petroleum engineering
            which i obtained in 2011, followed by a master degree in education obtained in 2013 and i've been working for the past
            three years as a financial advisor for one canadian bank. So why am i learning to code? well it started as a game/challenge
            between my very talented husband (web analyst) and I. As i started my self learning journey (in march 2016) i started to realize that
            i actually enjoyed what i was doing. so for the past months i've been dedicating at least two hours a day towards learning to code and
            my objective has now switch to the clear objective of making a career change.

        <h2 id="lesson1">The basics of HTML</h2>
        <div class="contenttext">
            <h4>Definitions</h4>
            <p> <b>HTML</b> stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the main type
                of documents found on the internet.<br>
                <b>Servers</b> are giant computers with the purpose to store information that are
                later retrieve and display on the internet.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="contenttext">
            <h4>Some terminologies</h4>
            <p>In HTML we use &lt;tags&gt;and some tags have an opening and closing tag such as the
            paragraph tag  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt; or it can only have a single tag such as the image tag &lt;img&gt; .<br>
            In addition, those tags can also be <em>inline </em>  such as the break tag  &lt;br&gt; or they can be <em> block</em> such as the Div tag
                &lt;div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; .</p>
        </div>

        <div class="contenttext">

            <h4>Examples</h4>
            <p> To display a few of the tags we've learn today, here are some examples <br>
            i'm a <b> newbie </b>  but i'm <em> determined </em>.<br>
        <!--(in this example we make use of both the bold and italic tag as well as the paragraph tag)-->

    <div class="content">
        <h2 id="lesson2">Structure a document with HTML</h2>
        <div class="contenttext">
            <h4>Boxes</h4>
            <p>When you look at a webpage it’s important to be able to see it as one big box containing tons of small boxes
            and your ability to identify these boxes will make you get a better structure of your html document and as a
            result get a better webpage. These boxes are represented as divs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="contenttext">
            <h4>Tree Structure</h4>
            <p>the previous concept of boxes gives rise to a hierarchical relationship between the elements where the main box
            can be seen as parents and the small boxes inside would be child of that element.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="contenttext">
            <h4>Developer Tools </h4>
            <p>The developer tool is a powerful instrument as it allows you to dissect the page. Through the dev tools you
            are able to see both the sturcture and the style of each element on the webpage.</p>
        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2 id="lesson3">The basics of CSS </h2>

        <div class="contenttext">
            <h4>Definitions</h4>
            <p> CSS stands for cascading style sheet. Cascading simply means that the style that the browser will look for
            the most specific rule (style) to apply to an element. It goes from the bigger style (given to the parent)
            and makes its way down the tree until it finds a more specific rule (if any)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="contenttext">
            <h4>Some CSS rules</h4>
            <p>There are some cool and powerful rules we can use such as:<br>
                &lt;display: flex &gt; which will help you position your boxes properly within the same div.<br>
                &lt;border radius:xx&gt; which will give your box rounded corners if that’s what you are going for</p>
